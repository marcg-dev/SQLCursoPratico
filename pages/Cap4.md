## Chapter 4 - Creating a Database

From this chapter on, our exercises will be about creating the physical model of the database. We will know in practice the syntax of the SQL language.

But, before we create any table, we already need to know how to define the data types and size of each field.

Let's get to the exercises. :nerd_face:
